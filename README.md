# Queue Implementation in Python
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Queue using a list. The queue follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle and includes basic operations:

# Features
1) Enqueue (enqueue(x)): Add an element to the end of the queue.
2) Dequeue (dequeue()): Remove the front element. Displays a message if the queue is empty.
3) Peek (peek()): View the front element without removing it. Displays a message if the queue is empty.
4) IsEmpty (isempty()): Check if the queue is empty.
